# Arctic Code Vault
My code was sent to the north pole.
All the segment faults. Invalid
access. And stack overflows. 
And I was told
that one day the vault would be moved
to Pluto. An archive for humanity, carved
on giant obelisks made of 
granite. There lies my code, silently rendering
compiler error, and consuming extra
threads, even it's a static 
cast on the monument. Observed by
all the stellar travellers carrying different
types of editor themes. Please tell them I 
like Nord the most.
