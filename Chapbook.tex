\par{} Though written in 1965, I always feel like this lyric is all about what 21 century people do. Does someone really have a sense of what he/she' is going to do, or whom he/she would become? I believe most of us don't. In that sense, our so-called daily routine, are all vain attempts. We gave them meanings, which they probably don't deserve.

\par{} So, forget about your stupid programming project, or lab reports, or other stuff. Problems will sort themselves out, in the mean time better write some poems.

\par{} This chapbook collects 15 of my poems. I don't usually write about sublimity, but instead I focus on those bizarre moments, moments that do not belong to this world, moments that only exist in my nowhere land. I explore the twisted ideas, most genrated from my dreams. I record how I look at this world, in my own way, which may be shitty in its form, but hopefully interesting behind the curtain.

\poemtitle{Opportunity's mission}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{back in Mojave, at dusk. If weather permits a stretch}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    The rover sees no difference between\\
    Mars and Earth. The same vast plain\\
    with some pits at the center and ridges lie far. \\
    Her internal clock always claim\\
    that a sol is no different than a day\\
    except forty more minutes of slack.\\
    Therefore most of time she rests\\
    on the edge of a crater. And soaked\\
    in the dim sunlight just like\\
    back in Mojave, at dusk. If weather permits a stretch \\
    she'll notify those remote engineers and\\
    never use up her cell. Until\\
    the day when she looked upon\\
    the glowing dome where she came from,\\
    it stroke her that Mars is different than\\
    Earth. It has two moons. One in clear sight\\
    but the other concealed itself behind\\
    the approaching sandstorm.\\
    Soon she felt drowsy underneath\\
    a sudden dune who promises\\
    gloomy sleepiness, then tranquil dormancy.\\
    Opportunity needs a distant dream\\
    after all this place is not Earthly\\
    and her cell is now empty.\\

\poemtitle{Silver lining}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{But not from above. There's a vast ocean of dust and vapor}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    They say every cloud has a silver lining\\
    But not from above. There's a vast ocean of dust and vapor\\
    convolving with fragments of thin air.\\
    You must read that things don't get better here.\\
    Only in such perspective can you\\
    understand buoyancy, how the clouds become\\
    borderless tides. How the sunlight turns into\\
    the opposite nights. Then if you look down you'd find\\
    there are no lines. Only discontinuity of waves\\
    where sailors are granted a peek to Atlantis.\\
    After that, to return from the stratosphere\\
    is to claim one will never reach the land. \\
    Each descend becomes a deeper dive. Now look above\\
    Do you still see the silver lining?\\

\poemtitle{Woke}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{feel like something is lost, while something is gained}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    I often find myself wake up in \\
    dreams, this time on a flight to Chicago. \\
    The trip is bumpy and I feel dizzy though \\
    the world in a bizarre glow. Everyone \\
    is staring at the window: \\
    a pale white sky against the dull dark inside \\
    above which hangs an azure sun. My neighbor \\
    explains to me that we are flying across a glacial \\
    or maybe just a vast floating ice. \\
    Just like those sea fowls, they always \\
    hover and circle, searching for \\
    a precious ground to land on or they'd soak \\
    in the chilling desert. \\
    \hspace*{\fill} \\
    We must have crossed September since \\
    aurora starts to gleam, \\
    but all the ice is melting as if \\
    arctic does have spring. \\
    Were I a sea fowl, I'd choose to leave the north \\
    with the wind, or the turbulence from \\
    aircrafts that passes by. \\
    But then inside that aircraft everything starts to \\
    decompose into basic strings. \\
    In that violent vibration I woke, and \\
    feel like something is lost, while something is gained \\
    ——it's even better, for one to wake up \\
    in the middle of a trip; the sun is now turquoise. \\
